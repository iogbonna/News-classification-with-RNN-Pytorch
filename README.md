# AG News Classification using PyTorch RNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates text classification on the AG News dataset using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented in PyTorch. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

## Features
- Preprocesses the AG News dataset into a format suitable for training an RNN.
- Implements an RNN model using PyTorch for text classification.
- Provides step-by-step guidance for training and evaluating the model.
- Includes visualizations to interpret the results and evaluate the model's performance.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, it is recommended you have a virtual environment with Pytorch installed
